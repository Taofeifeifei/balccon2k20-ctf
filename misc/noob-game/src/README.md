# Setup

A flag is `BCTF{w0w_i_cant_believe_it_chess_steg0_fantastic}`.

Go to [https://incoherency.co.uk/chess-steg/index.html] and do "Steg without blunders".

You will get a game which ends on 79th move.

However, it's strange that game ends so fast with a resign. So we import the resulting PGN to lichess.org:

https://lichess.org/f6l2KTqF

and continue it to the end.

https://lichess.org/Z12l2Pjf

The resulting [noob-game.pgn] has 108 moves. We export the same game using "Share as a GIF" and provide the resulting [GIF file](../challenge/noob-game.gif) to CTF players.
