# Ping Pong

## Description

Bad actors are communicating using some weird network protocol. We managed to intercept one such communication, but it was some time ago...

[pingpong.pcap](challenge/pingpong.pcap)

## Run challenge

Probably we will need to run the challenge on a separate VPS, because we need to work with ICMP and raw sockets.

See [setup](src/README.md)

## Solution

See [solution](solution/README.md)
